# ProteinCHAOS
MD-inspired protein art generator in your browser

This software is a merge of scientific concepts and artistic interpretations. While efforts have been made to ensure accuracy, the generated visuals may not perfectly represent real-world protein dynamics. Think about it as a creative exploration rather than a precise scientific tool.

Inspired by long exposure photography, generative art, and molecular dynamics simulations, ProteinCHAOS brings proteins to life through motion and color.
